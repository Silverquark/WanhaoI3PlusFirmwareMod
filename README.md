# Mods implemented:

LCD Firmware:
- access to sd/print menu without sdcard inserted

Printer Firmware:
- Diagonal leveling assistant

All changes made so far are independent from the other firmware.
So you can install only printer firmware mod to get sdmenu mod or only printer firmware for diagonal leveling. Or both.

# Mods Planned:
- Multiple preheat profiles with different temperatures (hotend/bed)
- Subfolder support for sdcard
- [Complete menu redesign](http://imgur.com/VQiZ4BC) (Will require removal of chinese translation for space reasons)

# Things i noticed:

It looks like there are different versions of the screen in circulation. Mine is "DMT48270M050_06W". [But i found screenshots of others with different versions](https://i2.wp.com/3dprinterwiki.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_8041.jpeg). I think they should all be compatible, but if it's not working on your screen, this may or may not be the cause.
